Ken,

I don't want them to go to the prison.

You can reach him at any of the above numbers.

I finally found Franco Bernabe's work number: +39-06-3600-4741

If so, let's do it over lunch as I know he has a 15 min. video to show us.  
Also, I'd like to include Cindy and whomever else you wish.

    Larwence Sampson (this is how he wrote his name down)

        Home phone     -    713/686-5781

Please advise.  Love, L.
