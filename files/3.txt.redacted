To Mr. █████████ █████████,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in █████████, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of █████████ consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $█████████ the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $█████████'s employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

█████████ █████████
